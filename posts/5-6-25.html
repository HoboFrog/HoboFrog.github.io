        <h2>Caffine is fun</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="post-paragraph">Well if anyone just so happened to be looking at my commit history they might notice that I had quite a few of them last night. If you want the long short I pulled an all nighter and worked on the website to make me feel good. If you don‚Äôt want the long long, you can skip to here.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">A lot of this comes down to stress, and a lot of the stress can be pinned down to a couple of reasons,</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">- Hungry, I rarely wake up early enough to eat breakfast</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">- Tired, I have difficulty falling asleep and am always tired</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">- The previous day I had dipped into that day's screen time, yes I still had limited screen time as a junior in highschool with good grades. So I had to worry about how I was going </p>
<p class="post-paragraph">- My earbuds had fallen out of my pocket when I was getting in my car and I had run them over. This may not seem like a huge deal but music is basically my lifeline right now, just barely getting me through the day. So I was very stressed not knowing if they still worked.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">- My ap-calc grades worked like this: there were 28 units, each unit you took three, four point tests. The two best out of those three were added together and put in the gradebook. These tests made up 100% of your grade, and I was 4 points away from an A. So I re-took four of the tests and got four points back! Then I found out I wrote down one of the tests wrong and I was four more points away, but I had already told my mom I had an A so I basically needed to get it up to an A immediately.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="post-paragraph">Those reasons, among other things and my normal difficulty sleeping, meant there was no way I was going to fall asleep on-time. So I decided to code this website instead.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="post-paragraph">Eventually, probably around 2am, I decided it would be a wise idea to try and get *some* form of sleep, but when I went to my bed, I noticed my clock was not functioning. Which means I had nothing to wake me up, and considering I needed to wake up in less than 4.5h, there was no chance I would wake up on my own. So I basically had to just stay up.
<br><br>
<p sclass="post-paragraph">Now I am sitting in my first period, with an energy drink and a hope I can make it through my day.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Anyways, first period is about to end, I‚Äôm not sure what today will bring, but hopefully your day is better than mine.</p>
<br>
<p class="post-paragraph">Peace‚úåÔ∏è,</p>
