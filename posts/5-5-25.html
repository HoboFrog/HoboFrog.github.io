        <h2>Site construction has begun</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="post-paragraph">Today I decided I wanted to make my own blog, because I don't feel like there is anyone or anywhere where I can share my thoughts freely and safely ish. Hopefully I have enough coding prowess and time to make this a half decent website for us to enjoy.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="post-paragraph">I should probably talk a bit more about the core reason I am making this blog in the first place. I have been very much struggling to even get through my day these past months. I want to share about some of the struggles I have been going through, mostly as a form of therapy for myself, but also hopefully to help anyone else who might be going through anything similar.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="post-paragraph">I donâ€™t recommend this, as this site is extremely scuffed, probably has a vulnerability that leaks my email and name, and isnâ€™t very easy to use. However, my code is open source at this point, so if anyone wants to, they can make a github fork of my repo and make their own blog.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="post-paragraph">Anyways, I will probably keep this post to just this, and dive more into my life in a later post, so thank you for stopping by my little slice of the internet.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="post-paragraph">Hope to see you in the next post</p>
        <p class="post-paragraph">Love,</p>
