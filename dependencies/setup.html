        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Thanks for dropping by my site. I'm just some random dude who enjoys everything technology and computer related. This site is just a little hobby project right now, but maybe I will get enough time to make it into a proper website. For now I will just be sharing some info I know and venting a bit about my life.</p>
